# Computer Science Society Club

Hello everyone!

Welcome to our <a href="https://jjaycss.tech/">Club's Official Website</a> Repository. This website was finished this past January of 2022. We hope you all liked how it came out. However, we now have made this repository <b>public</b> so you all will be able to contribute to future features that you believe the Club should add to the website or if you have any concerns and suggestions. Learn more on how to get started below:

## How to Contribute to New Club Website Features
If you'd like to get new features that you believe will enhance our Club's website, then the best way for this to happen is through creating a pull request. The following steps will only be able to be done if you have connected your systems terminal to your Github account.
### Create a Pull Request:
1) You will need to first clone this repository
    - Click on the green "Code" button on this repository.
    - Under "SSH", copy the link that you see there. It should look like this `git@github.com:jjcss/CSS_Website.git`
    - Go to your terminal. Make sure you aren't in another folder.
    - Type in the command `git clone git@github.com:jjcss/CSS_Website.git`
    - You should now have a new folder in your system name "CSS_Website"
    - If you followed the steps correctly then you have now cloned this repository correctly
2) Open up the new repository folder ("CSS_Website") in your IDE
    - For this example, we'll make Visual Studio Code our IDE. 
    - Let's cd into the CSS_Website folder with this command on your terminal `cd CSS_Website`. You can also drag the selected folder into your terminal after `cd`.
    - Open up Visual Studio Code and open up the CSS_Website folder from inside.
3) After succesfully navigating into the CSS_Website Folder, create a new branch:
    - To create a new branch insert commang `git checkout -b randomName` into your terminal (Make Sure branch name is specific to the feature you want to add)
    - Begin coding the new features that you'd like to add to the website.
    - After you're finished commit these new changes
    - Enter command `git add .` to add all files that had any new changes.
    - Enter command `git commit -m "message pertaining to feature"`
4) After adding new code in your new branch, create a pull request
    - Now that you've committed the new changes to your new branch, push all these new changes to the Club's repository with the command `git push origin nameOfBranchYouAreWorkingOn`
    - Head over to the club's repository and you should now see a yellow warning of a pull request. Click it and insert all the necessary information
    - Make sure to be really specific as to what feature you just did. This way, executives of the club will be able to quickly look over your pull request and your code. Don't forget to check if the club is on the "Reviewers" section. If not, then add the club to the list, which is jjcss.
5) Wait for a club executive to approve of your pull request. Any comments or concerns about your pull request will be inside of the pull request you created.

### Open a New Discussion:
If you have any new ideas, resources, features, questions related to the club website, or errors on the website that you would like to let us know, then click on the green button "New Discussion".

1) Head over to "Discussions" in this repository.
