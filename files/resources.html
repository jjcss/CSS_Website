            If you are a Computer Science major and don't know about Git and Github or if you've never used it before, then we suggest that you begin using them as soon as possible. We say this because in most tech companies, you will have to use Git and Github for big projects, with multiple developers. For those who don't know, Git is an open source version control system used to handle small or large projects. Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Many companies, if you're applying for internships, sometimes ask for your Github link to see what projects you've worked on or are working on. Lasty, after you familiarize yourself with some of the basic Git commands, then begin using terminal and creating branches for every project you work on, no matter the size.

            WayUp is a great platform to seek for Computer Science related internships. They also provide information on internships that are currently open. As you all know, getting an internship(s) during your college years is very important. This will enable you to possibly get a return offer once you graduate. Getting a full-time role with no prior internship experience can be a bit difficult, so preparing and getting those interviews should be something CS students should be aiming for.

            Levels Fyi is an amazing platform to look for up to date tech salaries, ranging from internships to full-time salaries. Figuring out salaries is good to know when you get to the offer stage when applying to jobs. Knowing the average salary for someone in that position and company will be useful so you can be able to negotiate for a higher salary.

            As we all know, in the Computer Science field, coding plays a huge part in the development process of a project. However, during the development process, before you begin coding, you need to have some sort of layout or template of how you'd like your project to look like and it's functionality. This is where Design Tools come into play. Check out this link to get started in designing a prototype of your project if you're interested in UI/UX design.

For Software Engineer positions, almost always, you will have a technical interview, where you'll be expected to solve any coding problem given to you. Usually, these coding problems can be found on Leetcode. Leetcode will help you build up that confidence you need to solve these complex problems, but you most continue practicing.
